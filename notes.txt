- first time: take marginal cost+ something, 
- second: take his bid and estimate his cost + higher percentage
- inside of game : estimate his mean bid, variance,
if my_marginal_cost is lower than other_next_bid_estimate-const*variance
    bid with something between marginal cost and lower than other_next_bid_estimate-const*variance
else 
    bid with something higher than other_next_bid_estimate+const*variance
    OR max loss
    
list with old bids of adversary + margins
method predict our next bid :
    predict adversary bid


method estimate marginal cost (using the plan till now (sls))
    for adversary: mean of possible start cities
        + estimated margin (%) (regression on old margins??)
